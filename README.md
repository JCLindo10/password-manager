# password-manager
A little project for personal use

For most people in today's day and age, opening new accounts on verious websites is not new, and each new account needs a new password. Especially for those looking for jobs or doing other such tasks, creating accounts on websites is almost a daily occurrence. This necessitates the use of some sort of password manager. 

This password manager is a personal project for a few Computer Scientists, created to fill this need. There are various planned features.

Planned features:
    - Password storage (including username and website)
    - Password encryption/decryption (for storage)
    - SSH key authentication
    - Customizable password generation (length, types of characters, etc.)
    - Beautiful GUI

This project will not only exercise algorithmic thinking, but cryptography, authentication and security, UI design, and databasing, among other possibilities.
